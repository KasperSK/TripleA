This report describes a fourth semester project at Aarhus School of Engineering at Aarhus University; 
the field of study is information technology. 
The problem definition of the project is to design and implement a digital cash register, which is easy to use even if the bartender is a bit tipsy. 
Katrines KÃ¦lder - the Friday afternoon bar at Katrinebjerg Campus - made the project proposal.
\newline
\newline
To solve the problem definition, a \gls{GUI} is designed and implemented in \gls{WPF}. 
The \gls{GUI} is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
At the same time, a business logic layer is made, which is responsible for sales and other functions. 
Every bit of data is going to be saved in a database and can be accessed through a web interface, which enables editing of products and the like. 
This enables the bartender to use the cash register for sales, while it enables an administrator to add/remove products and see which sales have been made. 
\newline
\newline
The product will be a digital cash register with a user-friendly \gls{GUI} that is able to print receipts and receive cash payment, with options for developing other payment methods. 
There will also be a \gls{WebAPI} that makes it possible to add/remove products, product groups, product types and product tabs in the database. 
It will also be possible to get an overview of what has been sold. 
\newline
\newline
The development process has been executed iteratively and elements of Scrum have been used. 
The work has been structured in sprints lasting for two weeks. 
In every iteration, the documentation and the report were compiled. 
The documentation is structured after the N+1 model, and it has been updated as experience was gathered during the sprints.
